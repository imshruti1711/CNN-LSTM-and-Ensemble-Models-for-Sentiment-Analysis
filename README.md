## Project title:

Sentiment Analysis of IMDB movie reviews 


## Summary:

The rising demand for digital entertainment and stiff competition among various players in the industry make it crucial for OTT platforms to develop a robust technique to understand customer preferences. Sentiment Analysis of IMDB movie reviews is one such cutting-edge method to achieve this. The aim of this project is to determine the best deep learning technique for sentiment analysis so that the results obtained are reliable and efficient. This project uses two deep learning techniques- CNN and LSTM to perform sentiment analysis on the keras imdb dataset. For optimising the results obtained using both these models, this project would use Hparams to determine the optimal number of convolutional layers, number of units and nodes in the dense layer, learning rate, dropout rate, optimizer and L2 regulariser which yield the highest prediction accuracy. This project also builds an ensemble model using CNN and LSTM to combine the strengths of both (an active research area). Finally, it compares the performance of the CNN, LSTM and ensemble models to determine the best technique for sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews.
